(if you want to check out our text-to-SQL guide using these modules, take a look [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/struct_indices/SQLIndexDemo.html)). This guide implements an advanced version of those modules, giving you the utmost flexibility to apply this to your own setting."
